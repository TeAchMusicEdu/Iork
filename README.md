# I-Ork
The I-Ork (Inclusive Orchestra) project aims to create a group of performers of accessible electronic instruments (ADMIs) featuring simplified control surfaces that allow music to be performed even by those who do not have full mastery or lack of movement of certain body parts. <br><br>
Our I-Ork project is designed with the aim of enabling everyone to play and share the performance experience in a collective context. For this reason, in the Inclusive Orchestra the performers of accessible electronic instruments are able-bodied and disabled musicians who have the same expressive possibilities through instruments adapted to their abilities. <br><br>
